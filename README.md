## Hi, I'm Vannessa!
I'm a Computer Science and Cognitive Science double major @ Rutgers University.

My passions are oriented towards:
  - ML/AI applications! Specifically how we can use reinforcement learning algorithms to       model real-world conflicts, predict future outcomes, and tool development. 
  - Computer graphics! Particularly in artistic tool development for animated film
    pipelines and artists. 

Currently, I'm seeking 2026 internships roles in ML/AI, SWE, TD, and Graphics!

  - Academic Computer Science Assignments: 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... 
  - Digital Content Creation Software (DCCs) such as Blender, Maya, and Houdini to learn     more about the 3D animation pipeline. So far I've touched on layout composition,         modeling, texturing, and lighting!
  - How to train datasets to develop predictive machine learning models with Cornell!


âš¡Outside of academics I am...
  - A fine arts painter in oils, watercolors, and acrylics.
  - A growing dancer in the East Coast dance community exploring street-styles.
  - A lover of exercise and the outdoors!
